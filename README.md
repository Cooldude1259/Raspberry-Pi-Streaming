## About
Raspberry Pi Streaming is a project I pursued to make. I wanted a streaming service type program to run on my new Raspberry Pi 5. The program doesn't require any new Python packages. The GUI is a website containing blocks with Thumbnails of the videos and their titles.

## Keep in mind
Please keep in mind that this code was created on and for a Raspberry Pi 5. Other Raspberry Pi's may work but maybe not. This code is pretty much supported for Linux.
